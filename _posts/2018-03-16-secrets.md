### Introduction

In a previous blog, [Linking Auth0 with React/Redux & Express App](https://nayema.ca/auth0/), I briefly touched 
base upon setting up my API keys using environment variables (env vars). These keys are my secrets.

A **secret** is a factor you need in order to run your app, which can also vary in different environments. You also 
don't want to allow public access to your secrets to avoid others from maliciously abusing it.

I will discuss why and how I chose to hide my secrets using env vars below.

### Problem

While developing [Shnoodo](https://shnoodo.herokuapp.com/), I realized I have a lot of API keys that I needed to hide 
from public users, both in the front-end and back-end. I also had different configurations for production and 
development environments.

### Guiding Principles

* Security: Hiding private API keys and configurations that are specific for the app
* Deployability: Conveniently change configurations for different environments

### Configuration File

During my research, I found a couple ways to tackle my problem. The first one was creating a `config.js` (git ignored)
file and store my secrets like this:

```javascript
export default const config = {
  MY_SECRET: 'mySecret'
}
```

This file is then imported into the file that needs the secret:

```javascript
import config from './config'

function sendTweet (tweet) {
  // ...
  twitterApi.configure(config.MY_SECRET).send(tweet)
}
```

While this solved my problem of hiding API keys, this was not a convenient way to change the configurations for 
different environments. I would still need to create this file for each environment as a post deployment step.

### Environment Variables

The second approach I came across was using environment variables to access my secrets:

```javascript
function sendTweet (tweet) {
  // ...
  twitterApi.configure(process.env.MY_SECRET).send(tweet)
}
```

Then I would make this secret available to my program in the terminal, when I am running it like this:

`MY_SECRET=mySecret node myProgram.js`

The issue with this is that I don't want to set different secrets in the terminal manually for local development. In 
contrast, I only have to set up all my secrets and configurations in Heroku once for deployment.

### Local Development

A great library I found to mitigate manual entries in the terminal is [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv). 
Installation for this is described in their README. 

Direnv checks for a `.envrc` bash file, which if authorized, can be used to export environment variables and make
 them available in your current shell when you are in the project directory.

_**The following files are set up in the root directory of my app:**_

```
.
├── .env (git ignored)
├── .env.production (git ignored)
├── .env.sample
└── .envrc
```

`.envrc`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

export PATH=./node_modules/.bin/:$PATH

# Common environment variables
set -o allexport
source ./.env
set +o allexport
```

The above code sets the env vars in the shell, sourced from the `.env` file as stated.

`.env` (git ignored)

```
MY_SECRET=mySecret
```

For other developers to know which env vars are required for my application, I set up a `.env.sample` file.

```
MY_SECRET=
```

### Deployment

Although I am able to set up my env vars in Heroku manually, I decided to put the env vars for production in a 
separate file:
 
`.env.production` (git ignored)

```
MY_SECRET=mySecret
```

I then use the following bash command to set the env vars in Heroku through the terminal:

```bash
sed 's/#[^(\"|'')]*$//;s/^#.*$//' .env.production | xargs heroku config:set --app=myapp
```

### Conclusion

It's crucial to hide factors which can be easily abused if publically accessed. Approaches such as direnv, 
.gitignore and env vars help manage this problem. Leaked access keys in open sourced project **may** lead to an 
unexpected $6,000 bill overnight such as [Ryan Hellyer's AWS Nightmare](https://wptavern.com/ryan-hellyers-aws-nightmare-leaked-access-keys-result-in-a-6000-bill-overnight).
