### Introduction

In many of my projects such as [Shnoodo](https://shnoodo.herokuapp.com/), you will notice asynchronous code marked with **async/await**.

Why did I need to do that? This is because Javascript code CAN run asynchronously. Meaning my second line of code will 
not wait for my first line of code to be executed. They will be run simultaneously.

Consider the following examples of Synchronous and Asynchronous code:

#### Synchronous

```javascript
console.log('Today')

console.log('is a')

console.log('wonderful day.')
```

OUTPUT:

```text
Today 
is a 
wonderful day.
```

In the above example, these lines of code are being executed sequentially.

#### Asynchronous

```javascript
console.log('Today')

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('is a')
}, 2000)

console.log('wonderful day.')
```

OUTPUT:

```text
Today 
wonderful day.
is a 
```

Notice, the third line of code ran before the second line, because of the 2 second delay set for 'wonderful day'. 
This is asynchronous code.

### Problem

We have established that JavaScript code runs asynchronously with the examples above. The problem I will try to 
tackle in this article is how to postpone some code from executing when it depends on some previously declared code 
having fully ran. 
 
### Guiding Principles

* Readability: Writing clean code that is easy to reason about
* Extensibility: Writing code that can be easily extended

### Promises

A **Promise** wraps an asynchronous function and allows chaining dependent functions using `.then()`. The function 
inside the promise will need to be completed before the function subsequently in the `.then()` is executed.
 
A promise can be in any one of these following states:
* Pending - the promise hasn't been resolved or rejected yet.
* Resolved - the action relating to the promise has been fulfilled.
* Rejected - the action has failed.
* Settled - the promise has been resolved or rejected.

The example below "Promisifies" the issue we encountered above.

```javascript
function delay (task, milliseconds) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    setTimeout(() =>  {
        task()
        resolve()
    }, milliseconds)
)}

console.log('Today')

delay(() => {
    console.log('is a')
}, 2000)
.then(() => {
    console.log('wonderful day.')
})
``` 
OUTPUT:

```text
Today 
is a 
wonderful day.
```

### Async and Await

Async/await is a new way to write asynchronous code which provides better readability. This is how the above code will 
look like when refactored with async/await:

```javascript
(async () => {
    console.log('Today')
    
    await delay(() => {
        console.log('is a')
    }, 2000)
    
    console.log('wonderful day.')
})()
```

OUTPUT:

```text
Today 
is a 
wonderful day.
```

The above code reads much better than using `.then()` function. This also avoids having to use any nesting ot callbacks.

### Conclusion

I hope this article helps you write asynchronous code in a more concise and readable way. If you
